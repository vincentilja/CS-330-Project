        <h1>C++: A History</h1>
        <h2>What is C?</h2>
        <p>Being itself a derivative of BCPL and later B, much of C's development
            coincided with the creation of the Unix operating system, starting roughly around 1969.
            Ken Thompson, the developer of Unix, realized that the operating system didn't yet
            have a programming language associated with it, creating B. However, programmers working with
            B hit frequent roadblocks, most notably its singular data type and its inability to perform floating
            point arithmetic. C was born from an effort to combat these issues, offering an alternative both to B and to assembly
            language. Many integral aspects one might expect to see in a modern programming language, 
            such the ability to create classes, were absent. Despite this, it would continue to be used as the Unix operating
            system became widely used by computer scientists.
        </p>
        <h2>Enter Bjarne Stroustrup</h2>
        <p>Then a PhD candidate with the University of Cambridge's Computing Laboratory, Danish computer scientist
            Bjarne Stroustrup conceived the C++ programming language while studying the limitations of the Unix kernel and the 
        original C programming language, namely its lack of classes. Stroustrup sought to combine aspects of C with object oriented
    programming languages like Simula. Simula was originally meant to serve as the backbone for what would become C++, but it proved
to be too slow to properly implement. As a staff member of Bell Labs' Computer Science Research Center, Stroustrup painstakingly put together
simulations for what was intended to be an offshoot of C, ignorant to the fact that his creation would supersede its predecessor.</p>
        <h2>C with Classes</h2>
        <p>Stroustrup's intent to build upon C becomes clear from his original name for C++, C with Classes. This is a bit of an understatement,
            seeing as C with Classes introduced a plethora of new features including:
        
        <li>the titular Classes</li>
        <li>Inline functions</li>
        <li>Inheritance</li>
        <li>Type checking</li>
        <li>etc.</li>
        A compiler was created to run C with Classes, called Cfront which in turn was inspired by Cpre, a compiler used alongside the original C 
            programming language. Cfront can be considered a self-hosting compiler, as it was largely written using C with Classes. The creation of
            this compiler would have great impact on the development of the C++ language as well as the Unix operating system, which provided the inspiration
            for C.
        </p>
        <h2>The Birth of C++</h2>
        <p>In 1983, fellow computer scientist Rick Mascitti proposed that C with Classes be renamed C++, in reference to variable incrementation. This
            change happened alongside improvements to the language including the addition of
            <li>Virtual functions</li>
            <li>The ability to comment</li>
            <li>The Const keyword</li>
            <li>The ability to name functions</li>
            <li>etc.</li>
            2 years later, Stroustrup would pen <i>The C++ Programming Language</i> alongside the programming language's release for commerical use.
            The language would undergo periodic updates before it became standardized, forcing those programming with C++ to purchase Stroustrup's reference
            guides with C++ 2.0 releasing in 1989 and C++ 3.0 releasing in 1991, with the most notable addition of class and function templates. One year prior to
            this, a compiler called Turbo C++ would be launched, allowing users to utilize new libraries. It still sees common use today. Finally in 1998, C++
            would be standardized as C++ISO/IEC14882:1998, also known as C++98.
        </p>
        <h2>C++ Now</h2>
        <p>C++ standards were updated throughout the years with C++03 in 2003 and C++11 in mid-2011, the latter being largely influenced by the Boost library project.
            New features introduced by C++11 included
            <li>Updated for loop syntax</li>
            <li>Randomization library</li>
            <li>Regular Expressions</li>
            <li>Auto keywords</li>
            <li>etc.</li>
        </p>
        <p>C++ has many applications including use in accounting programs, video game development, and operating systems because of its ability to communicate directly with 
            computer hardware, similar to assembly language. Seeing as the language was developed through Stroustrups experiments on the limitations of the Unix kernel and C's
            attempts to rival assembly language, this tracks.
