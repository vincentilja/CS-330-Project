        <h1>How to write Hello, World in C++</h1>
        <h2>Visual Studio Code</h2>
        <p>The first step of learning any program is being able to write it out. This is where Visual Studio Code (colloquially referred to as VSCode) comes into play!
            You can download VSCode by visiting this link: <a>https://code.visualstudio.com/download</a>, and downloading the version of VSCode corresponding to your operating
            system. Though this language doesn't come with a programming environment, VSCode is considered one of the best programming environments for C++. However, the user will
            need to complete a few extra steps before it is able to run.
        </p>
        <p>After VSCode is downloaded, input the command (Ctrl + Shift + X) or simply navigate to "Extensions" in the sidebar. Type "C/C++" into the search bar and download both
            C/C++ and the C/C++ Extension Pack.
        </p>
        <h2>Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) </h2>
        <p>You might hit a snag if you attempt to create a program in VSCode after following the previous steps. This is because C++ needs a special compiler to be downloaded
            in order for users to write C++ in VSCode. Go to this page: <a>https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#remote-tools-for-visual-studio-2022</a>, select the 
            "Tools for Visual Studio" dropdown menu and download the link associated with "Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022." Once the download has completed, open the
            Installer, select the "Desktop development with C++" square check box, and click Install in the bottom right corner.
        </p>
        <p>You can verify that it was set up correctly by opening "Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022" and inputting the command "cl". If it flashes a copyright statement and 
            displays "usage: cl [option... ] filename... [ /link linkoption...]", the download was successful. From here, create a folder in Developer Command Prompt using the 
            commands "mkdir folderName" and "cd folderName". Then create a subfolder using the commands "mkdir subFolder" and "cd subFolder", followed by "code ." This last command will
            open VSCode in the subfolder. Create a new file within which to write your "Hello, World" command.
        </p>
        <h2>Hello, World</h2>
        <h3>Comments</h3>
        <p>Comments in C++ can be made by using two frontslashes</p>
        <li>Example: // This is a comment</li>
        <h3>#include <iostream></h3>
            <p>This command allows the user to write statements from C++'s input-output library (io in iostream meaning "input-output"). Because a print statement is output, one must 
                include this command if one wants to use input-output library functions </p>
        <h3>using namespace std;</h3>
        <p>To prevent users from using the same name for functions and variables, C++ users must import something called a namespace, so that no collisions occur if a user created function 
            or variable is named similarly to a C++ function or variable. The "std" (read standard) namespace is the most commonly used C++ namespace as it contains the most basic features of C++.
        </p>
        <h3>main() function</h3>
        <p>Main functions work similarly in C++ as they do in other languages like Python. When the program is executed, it will immediately navigate to the main function call and begin executing the 
            code contained with it. Essentially, it provides a starting point for your code. You can use a main function to call other default or user created functions. Code within the main function is
            indented. You can indent codeblocks within a function by pressing the "Tab" key.
        </p>
        <h3>cout</h3>
        <p>cout, read as "c out", is the output or print function in C++ that allows you to print a specified string, integer, etc. to a terminal. The syntax is as follows:</p>
        <li>cout << "Hello, World!";</li>
        <p>Note that semicolons are required at the end of each statement</p>
        <h3>return</h3>
        <p>Users should include a return statement at the end of each function, even if it will not be used. For such a simple program with one output of one string, we can set the return value as 0</p>
        <li>return 0</li>
