/*To create string variables, you must import the C++ string library

// cout << myDouble + myFloat; //96.6666
// Something unexpected happens when I do this.
/*Rather than creating a new line and displaying the sum of
myDouble and myFloat, it concatenates 110.9 and 96.6666 as

// What happens if I divide an integer and float?
//cout << myInt/myFloat;

add these foreign data types into my array of strings. This means that an array
can only contain variables of one shared data value that is declared when the array is created*/
//What if I were to try to convert an integer to a float
//float myFloat = myInt;
//cout << myFloat;
/* When attempting to redefine myFloat as containing the value of myInt, it displays an
error. You cannot explicitly convert one data type to another data type*/
//float myInt;
//cout << myInt;
// Implicit redefinition is also a no-no in C++
//string x = "5" + 6;
//cout << x;
// The only output when I run this code is ยบ <-- this character. I have no idea what this is
//int x = "5" + 6;
//cout << x;
/* The same character "ยบ" is output when I attempt to run this code,
 saving x as an int type variable instead */
//Seemingly the only way for this operation to work would be to use the to_string() method
//string x = "5" + to_string(6);
//cout << x;
